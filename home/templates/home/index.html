                <p>The tie-ups brand was conceived in Northern Italy in 2008, with the name itself representing the union of the company's core values. Each belt is manufactured using cutting-edge technology, resulting in a stylish, durable product</p>
                <br>
                <p>Protection of the environment and animal welfare are key to the ethos of tie-ups. No animal based products are used in manufacturing and the belts are 100% recyclable.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The belts can be cut to size and the buckles are interchangeable allowing you to customize them to your wishes</p>
